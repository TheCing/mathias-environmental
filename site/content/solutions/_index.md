        UV light breaks down bacteria, viruses, molds, and other pathogens by
        damaging their DNA makeup, which is the fundamental building block of the
        microorganism. This leads to the eventual death of the microorganism and
        renders viruses inactive.

        The UV process is a physical, as opposed to a chemical, process. UV destroys or neutralizes viruses and microorganisms without chemically or physically impacting the indoor environment.

        Bipolar Ionization is integrated into the HVAC system to distribute vast
        numbers of charged ions that attach themselves to viruses, bacteria, mold
        and other types of particles and render them harmless by changing their
        physical/chemical structure.Â  It also causes very small particles to stick
        together to drop to the ground or allow your filtration system to be more
        effective in removing them from the air.

        Designing and placing advance air filter technology into your existing
        system adds another level of effectiveness or another type of approach.
        There are various filter types and approaches that can be considered, and
        some can capture up to 99% of airborne contaminants, including viruses and
        virus-laden particles. Your unique building and HVAC system will be
        thoroughly evaluated for this option by our team.

        Adding additional outdoor air into your indoor air environment is
        recommended by the CDC to improve indoor air quality and protect against
        the novel coronavirus and other airborne pathogens. Large increases in
        "fresh" air into your system is, perhaps, the most aggressive means of
        treating indoor air quality and can offer a highly effective solution. It
        is a solution that must be considered and implemented carefully and
        properly.
