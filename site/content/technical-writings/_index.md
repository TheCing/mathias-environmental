  heading: White Paper
  description: The following White Paper by Mathias Environmental and Wondermakers Environmental was conceived and created in order to provide meaningful information and analysis of the basic technology available for indoor air quality improvements in most facilities.  This is meant to provide both the basics of the science in a way that is useful for facility owners and operators, as well as to provide information that is not based upon marketing or any attempt to sell or promote a product or particular technological approach. There is a great deal of misunderstanding, bad science and misleading sales techniques that is causing not only confusion, but prompting many facility owners to purchase and install equipment that will likely fail to provide meaningful or measurable results.
