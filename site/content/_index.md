    Our approach, our team, and our ability to measure and certify results makes
    our solutions attractive for a wide range of buildings.  Not only are these
    solutions safe and efficient, but the results are clearly understandable and
    able to be explained easily to your staff, students and parents.
challenge:
  heading: The Challenge
  text: There are a lot of companies offering solutions and equipment in the
    market, but very few understand the science and can tailor the RIGHT
    solution to each unique condition and space.  Mathias understands the
    science, the technology and has over 25 years of experience with design,
    construction, maintenance and management of buildings and building
    mechanical systems.  It is the difference between getting "something" and
    getting something you understand will be effective and practical.

intro:
  heading: What We Offer
  text: Mathias Environmental helps high-use facilities such as schools,
    universities, medical offices, dental practices, restaurants, churches and
    office spaces to evaluate, design and implement effective indoor air quality
    strategies to battle the spread of pathogens. These include SARS-CoV-2 novel
    coronavirus and the H1N1 Flu virus. Our goal is to help you improve the
    indoor air quality of your facilities and help protect those that use them.

need:
  heading: The Need
  text: Air is flowing through your building constantly — cycling through multiple
    times per hour. Viruses, germs and other microorganisms can be cycled right
    along with it — and that’s a risk in today’s climate.

  heading: The Solution
  text: >-
    Mathias provides a multidisciplinary approach and a multifaceted solution
    analysis that we implement based on your needs and goals. Our solutions are
    based on science; they are measurable, confirmable, efficient, and
    effective.


    Potential solutions include: UVC, Advanced Air Filtering, Bipolar Ionization, Outdoor Air Enhancement, Airflow Management, Controls and Scheduling

solutions:
  - heading: Ultra Violet Light (UV-C)
    text: >
      UV light breaks down bacteria, viruses, molds, and other pathogens by
      damaging their DNA makeup, which is the fundamental building block of the
      microorganism. This leads to the eventual death of the microorganism and
      renders viruses inactive.

      The UV process is a physical, as opposed to a chemical, process. UV destroys or neutralizes viruses and microorganisms without chemically or physically impacting the indoor environment.
  - heading: Bipolar Ionization
    text: >
      Bipolar Ionization is integrated into the HVAC system to distribute vast
      numbers of charged ions that attach themselves to viruses, bacteria, mold
      and other types of particles and render them harmless by changing their
      physical/chemical structure.  It also causes very small particles to stick
      together to drop to the ground or allow your filtration system to be more
      effective in removing them from the air.
  - heading: Advanced Air Filtering
    text: Designing and placing advance air filter technology into your existing
      system adds another level of effectiveness or another type of approach.
      There are various filter types and approaches that can be considered, and
      some can capture up to 99% of airborne contaminants, including viruses and
      virus-laden particles. Your unique building and HVAC system will be
      thoroughly evaluated for this option by our team.
  - heading: Outdoor Air Enhancement
    text: Adding additional outdoor air into your indoor air environment is
      recommended by the CDC to improve indoor air quality and protect against
      the novel coronavirus and other airborne pathogens. Large increases in
      "fresh" air into your system is, perhaps, the most aggressive means of
      treating indoor air quality and can offer a highly effective solution. It
      is a solution that must be considered and implemented carefully and
      properly.

    makes our solutions attractive for a wide range of buildings. Not only are
    these solutions safe and efficient, but our clients can easily share these
    meaningful air quality improvements with those they are working hard to
    protect.  This demonstrates an obvious level of care and concern in terms of
    health and safety.
