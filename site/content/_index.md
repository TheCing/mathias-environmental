      UV light breaks down bacteria, viruses, molds, and other pathogens by
      damaging their DNA makeup, which is the fundamental building block of the
      microorganism. This leads to the eventual death of the microorganism and
      renders viruses inactive.

      The UV process is a physical, as opposed to a chemical, process. UV destroys or neutralizes viruses and microorganisms without chemically or physically impacting the indoor environment.

      Bipolar Ionization is integrated into the HVAC system to distribute vast
      numbers of charged ions that attach themselves to viruses, bacteria, mold
      and other types of particles and render them harmless by changing their
      physical/chemical structure.  It also causes very small particles to stick
      together to drop to the ground or allow your filtration system to be more
      effective in removing them from the air.

    text: Designing and placing advance air filter technology (i.e. HEPA or MERV 13+
      filters) into your existing system adds another level of effectiveness or
      another type of approach. There are various filter types and approaches
      that can be considered, and some can capture up to 99% of airborne
      contaminants, including viruses and virus-laden particles. Your unique
      building and HVAC system will be thoroughly evaluated for this option by
      our team.

    text: Adding additional outdoor air into your indoor air environment is
      recommended by the CDC to improve indoor air quality and protect against
      the novel coronavirus and other airborne pathogens. Large increases in
      "fresh" air into your system is, perhaps, the most aggressive means of
      treating indoor air quality and can offer a highly effective solution. It
      is a solution that must be considered and implemented carefully and
      properly.

  heading: The Need
  text: Air is flowing through your building constantly — cycling through multiple
    times per hour. Viruses, germs and other microorganisms can be cycled right
    along with it — and that’s a risk in today’s climate.
